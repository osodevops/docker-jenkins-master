  ### Running the container

  ```bash
    $ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --env-file=./env.file --name jenkins jenkins

  ```shell
    $docker build -f DockerfileSlave -t jenkins-slave .
    $docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --rm --name jenkins-slave jenkins-slave -url <master-url> <secret> <host>
  ```

   - __master-url__: is the URL of your jenkins
   - __ secret__: is the agent secret
   - __host__: is the agent name

  Add `-v /srv:/srv --privileged` on the target's slave
